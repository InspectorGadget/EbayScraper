# EbayScrapper

- You can add any link from *eBay*. If you want to edit, this code is pretty straightforward. Make sure you edit this using Visual Studio 2017 installed for .NET Frameworks for Microsoft Windows. 
- I've also pre-built the .exe and placed inside the "EbayScrapperEXE" zip folder. If you're being suspicous, don't hesitate to scan for viruses.

I tested this program using this link: https://www.ebay.com.my/sch/i.html?_nkw=xbox+one&_in_kw=1&_ex_kw=&_sacat=0&LH_Complete=1&_udlo=&_udhi=&_samilow=&_samihi=&_sadis=10&_fpos=&LH_SALE_CURRENCY=0&_sop=12&_dmd=1&_ipg=50
